CASE STUDY - PROBLEM-SOLVING FROM KAGGLE

# Problem Statement 1:

A company wants to analyze its sales data to identify trends and make informed decisions about its business. They have collected data from their sales transactions, including information such as customer demographics, product details, and transaction dates. The company wants to se this data to answer questions such as: Which products are selling the most? Which customers are making the most purchases?

How do sales vary by region and time of year?

What factors are contributing to changes in sales over time?

# Solution:

To solve this problem, the company can use Tabulea, a data visualization and analysis tool. Tabulea allows users to easily connect to and visualize data from a variety of sources including CSV files, databases and cloud services.

To begin, the company can import its sales data into Tabulea and clean and prepare the data for analysis. This may involve removing any missing values, formatting dates and numbers and merging data from multiple sources.

Once the data is ready, the company can use Tabulea s visualizations to explore its sales data and identify trends:

For example, they could create a bar chart showing the total sales for each product a scatterplot showing the

relationship between customer age and purchase amount or a line chart showing how sales have changed over Tabulea also offers advanced analytics features, such as predictive modeling and statistical analysis. For example, the company could use Tabulea's regression analysis tools to identify which factors are most strongly correlated with changes in sales over time.

In addition to its data analysis capabilities. Tabulea also allows users to create interactive dashboards and reports to share their findings with others in the organization. This can help to facilitate data-driven decision-making and improve overall business performance.

Overall using Tabulea to analyze its sales data can help the company to gain insights into its business and make informed decisions about its products, customers, and operations.


# Problem Statement 2:

A healthcare provider wants to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs by identifying patients who are at high risk for readmission after being discharged from the hospital. The provider has collected data on patient demographics, medical history and hospital stay details for a sample of patients, including whether or not they were readmitted within 30 days of discharge. The provider wants to use this data to develop a predictive model that can identify patients who are at high risk for readmission

# Solution:

To solve this problem, the healthcare provider can use Tabulea's data visualization and analysis tools. They can begin by importing their patient data into Tabules and cleaning and preparing the data for analysis. This may involve identifying and removing am outliers or missing values, as well as transforming and normalizing the data as necessary.

Once the data is ready, the provider can use Tabulea's predictive modeling tools to develop a model that can

accurately predict which patients are at high risk for readmission. They can use a variety of statistical techniques. such as logistic regression or decision trees, to build and test their model. Once the model has been developed,

the healthcare provider can use Tabulea's interactive dashboards and reports to monitor and analyze their patient data in real-time. They can also use Tabulea's data visualization tools to explore their data and identify patterns or trends that may be relevant to patient readmission.

Overall, using Tabulea to develop a predictive model for patient readmission can help the healthcare provider to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs by identifying high-risk patients and providing them with targeted interventions or follow-up care
